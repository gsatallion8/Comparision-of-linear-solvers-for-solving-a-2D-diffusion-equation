# Comparision-of-linear-solvers-for-solving-a-2D-diffusion-equation

Solving a 2D diffusion equation using finite volume methods requires one to invert huge sparse matrices. 
We compare iterative methods for inversion such as Gauss-Siedel method, line-by-line TDMA method, Steepest gradient method and Conjugate gradient method.
